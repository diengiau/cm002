-   Officer hour: Wednesday morning, R60705, but please email me to book in advance

-   My website: [official](https://www.cm.yzu.edu.tw/EN/Page/Teacher.aspx?ID=buidiengiau) and [personal](https://diengiau.github.io)

## The course

-   Mainly for business students

-   Basic but more practical

-   R programming language

## Materials

-   No official textbook

-   My lecture slides + codes + data

-   I will put everything into a public website: https://github.com/diengiau/cm002

-   But if you're new to R, please read this book for your references:

    -   R4DS: http://r4ds.had.co.nz

## Required software

-   R programming

    -   is one statistical programming language
    -   very popular in statistics, science, and ML projects

-   RStudio: and IDE for easier using R

-   Tough

-   ... but maybe help you in the future

## Why R?

-   To be consistent in the EBBA program:

    -   two courses will use R
    -   then you can take other courses for Python

-   Free (open-source) and flexible to small-big projects

-   Active and broad user community

    -   E.g., iOS community vs Blackberry community

## To install R

-   First, install R from R-CRAN

    -   Step 1: download R install file; Step 2-n: Yes, Yes, Yes

-   Second, install RStudio Desktop (free version)

-   Third, install R packages

    -   For data manipulation: `install.packages("tidyverse")`; for Mac user, `install.packages("dplyr")` is enough
    -   For string and date: `stringr`, `lubridate`
    -   For statistics: `janitor`, `skimr`, `broom`, `purrr`

-   Fourth, when use the packages: `library(tidyverse)`

## Lab vs your personal computer

-   IT staffs installed R and RStudio for you

-   But more convenient to have it installed in your own computer

-   Ask me or TA any time you have questions in class

## RStudio interface

## Some useful short-cut

-   **TAB**: for complete codes automatically
-   **CTRL+ENTER**: for possible options in the codes
-   **CTRL+SHIFT+M**: for the pipe `%>%` special letter
-   **CTRL+ALT+I**: for insert a new R code block into the **QMD**/RMD file

## QMD file

-   It is a special file format by RStudio, allowing you to write and code at the same time, using the `markdown` format
-   E.g., this file is a **QMD** file
-   Write: anything you type
-   Code: anything inside an R code block, by **CTRL+ALT+I** shortcut
-   It can **render** to many other file formats (docx, PDF, **HTML**, **revealjs**, ...) by click to **Render** button

## Any questions

-   Please don't ask for extra points at the semester end.
