## Layout of a dashboard

-   Column vs rows

-   Sidebar

-   Tabset: like tabs in Chrome web browser ([read here](https://quarto.org/docs/dashboards/layout.html#tabsets))

## Input

-   Plot

-   Table

-   Number

-   Text

## Steps to make a dashboard

1.  Think which contents to show to audience
2.  Design layout
3.  Put contents to layout
    1.  For plot: suggest to use interactive plot like `plotly`
    2.  For table: use `DT` table
4.  Change theme colors
5.  Deployment or publish the dashboard online

## Create a new quarto with these options on top

```{r}
#| eval: false
---
title: "An awesome dashboard"
author: "Richard"
format: dashboard

```

## Practice

-   Imagine that we have three plots: f1, f2, f3

-   We made it in Lecture 8

-   Let's discuss with your friends how to put them to a dashboard

## Design a layout

-   Refer to this website: [Layout](https://quarto.org/docs/dashboards/layout.html)

-   Re-analyze our three examples

-   Then, apply to design layout to our three plots: f1, f2, f3

## Themes

-   You can choose up to 25 different themes: [read here](https://quarto.org/docs/dashboards/theming.html)

    -   Add the `theme` option with corresponding theme choice on the top

-   Or customize a new one based on CSS

```{r}
#| eval: false

format:
  dashboard:
    theme: united
```

## Complete it

-   Let me show my dashboard first

    -   Each figure needs to beautiful first

-   OK, let work to make it and show me the results
